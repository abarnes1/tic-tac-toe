This is the tic-tac-toe project from The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.  It is the first Ruby that isn't a single problem code exercise and the first project with a focus on OOP.  With that in mind, I took great care to limit public function access to only those which are required to run the game.  The public interface functions in the TicTacToe and GameBoard classes also do not return objects capable of mutating private variables.

A big feature with this tic-tac-toe game is that it can be played at any size.  The computer can only choose a random remaining square so you may have more of a challenge playing another human.  It is, however, kind of funny to have two computer players face off in games so large that they have no hope of winning.

Key things I learned:
 1. Usage of enumerable methods - They are used a TON in this project.
 2. Public vs. private functions - Where and why functions should be in each category
 3. Class design - Although subjective, I think what I came up with at least makes sense.
 4. Ruby syntax - At a certain point I noticed that I had stopped constantly looking up syntax for a lot of enumerable methods and loops.
